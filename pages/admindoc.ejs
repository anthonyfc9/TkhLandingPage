            The "OOF" sound; derived from the sound played upon the death of a ROBLOX avatar, was started back in 2006 when ROBLOX launched. However, users of ROBLOX have taken to saying the "OOF" sound in person when they have also defeated another player in-game. The way of saying "OOF" this way was first started by the user "iiKnight_Mare" in February, 2016, whilst playing "The Streets"; a fairly popular player versus player game on ROBLOX. iiKnight_Mare states he had randomly started mocking the ROBLOX death noise towards players as a means of trolling them once they were defeated. He states he "randomly just started using the term one day and all of a sudden he sees a plethora of other players committing the same act a short while after". "I feel like it spread like wildfire", he said and "I didn't know it would drag so much attention from the online community".The "OOF" sound; derived from the sound played upon the death of a ROBLOX avatar, was started back in 2006 when ROBLOX launched.
